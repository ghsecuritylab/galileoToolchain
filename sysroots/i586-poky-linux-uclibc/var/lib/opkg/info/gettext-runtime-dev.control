Package: gettext-runtime-dev
Version: 0.18.2-r0
Description: Utilities and libraries for producing multi-lingual messages.
 Gettext offers to programmers, translators, and even users, a well
 integrated set of tools and documentation. Specifically, the GNU
 `gettext' utilities are a set of tools that provides a framework to help
 other GNU packages produce multi-lingual messages. These tools include a
 set of conventions about how programs should be written to support
 message catalogs, a directory and file naming organization for the
 message catalogs themselves, a runtime library supporting the retrieval
 of translated messages, and a few stand-alone programs to massage in
 various ways the sets of translatable strings, or already translated
 strings.
