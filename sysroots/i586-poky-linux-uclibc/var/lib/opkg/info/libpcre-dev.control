Version: 8.32-r1
Description: Perl Compatible Regular Expressions - Development files
 The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular expression
 pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl 5. PCRE has
 its own native API, as well as a set of wrapper functions that correspond
 to the POSIX regular expression API.  This package contains symbolic
 links, header files, and related items necessary for software
 development.
